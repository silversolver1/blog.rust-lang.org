author: The Rust Release Team
release: true
---

The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.51.0. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.

If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust
1.51.0 is as easy as:

```console
rustup update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can [get `rustup`][install]
from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the
[detailed release notes for 1.51.0][notes] on GitHub.

## What's in 1.51.0 stable
This release represents one of the largest additions to the Rust language and cargo in quite awhile. With the stabilization of const generics, and the new feature resolver, along with more minor additions such as the `split-debuginfo` option, and the `addr_of!` API. This has been one of the biggest releases in a long time. Let's dive right into it!


### Const Generics MVP
Before this release, Rust allowed you to haves your types be parameterized over lifetimes or types. For example if we wanted to have a `struct` that is generic over an array of 32 items, we'd write the following:

```rust
struct FixedArray<T> {
              // ^^^ Type generic definition
    list: [T; 32]
        // ^ Where we're using it.
}

// `FixedArray<u8>`
// becomes
// ```
// struct FixedArray_u8 {
//     list: [u8; 32]
// }
// ```
```

This is a powerful feature that allows you to write reusable code with no runtime overhead. Enabling to have types that fit a wide variety of use-cases and types. However until this release we've haven't really been able to easily be generic over the *values* of those types. This most notable in arrays where they include their length in their type definition (`[T; N]`). Now with 1.51.0 you can now write code that is generic over the values of any number, `bool`, or `char` type! (Using `structs` and `enum` values are still unstable.)

This change now lets us have our own array struct that's generic over its type *and* its length. Let's look an example definition, and how it can be used.

```rust
struct Array<T, const LENGTH: usize> {
    //          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `const` generic definition.
    list: [T; LENGTH]
    //        ^^^^^^ Where we're using it.
}

// Array<u8, 32>
// Becomes 
// ```
// struct Array_u8_32 {
//     list: [u8; 32]
// }
// ```

impl<T, const LENGTH: usize> Array<T, LENGTH> {
    fn last(&self) -> Option<&T> {
        if LENGTH == 0 {
        // ^^^^^^^^^^^ This is always `true` for `Array<T, 0>`.
            None
        } else {
            Some(self.list[LENGTH - 1])
        }
    }
}
```

Const generics adds an important new tool for library designer's in creating new powerful compile-time safe APIs. If you'd like to learn more about const generics you can also check out the ["Const Generics MVP Hits Beta"][const-generics-blog] blog post for more information about the feature and its current restrictions. We can't wait to see what new libraries and APIs you create!

### Cargo's New Feature Resolver
Dependency management is a hard problem, and one of the hardest parts of it is just picking what *version* of a dependency to use when it's depended on by two different packages, this doesn't just include its version number, but also what features are or aren't enabled for the package. Cargo's default behaviour is to merge features for a single package. Let's say you if you had a dependency called `foo` with features A and B, which was being used by packages `bar` and `baz`, but `bar` depends on `foo+A` and `baz` depends on `foo+B`, cargo will merge both of those features and compile `foo` as `foo+AB`. This has a benefit that you only have to compile `foo` once, and then it can reused for both `foo` and `bar`.

However, this also comes with a downside, what if `A` and `B` are incompatible? What if your own code is compatible with `foo` but not `foo+A`? A common example of this in the ecosystem is the optional `std` feature included in many `#![no_std]` crates, that allows crates to provide added functionality when `std` is available. Now imagine you want to use the `#![no_std]` version of `foo` in your `#![no_std]` binary, and use the `foo` at build time in your `build.rs`, if your build time dependency depends on `foo+std`, your binary now also depends on `foo+std`, which means it will no longer compile because `std` is not available for your target platform. 

This has been a long standing issue in cargo, and with this release there's a new `resolver` option in your `Cargo.toml`, where you can set `resolver="2"` to tell cargo to try a new approach to resolving features, you can check out [RFC 2957] a detailed description of the behaviour, but it can summarised as follows.

- **Dev dependencies** — When a package is shared as a normal dependency and a dev-dependency, the dev-dependency features are only enabled if the current build is including dev-dependencies.
- **Host Dependencies** — When a package is shared as a normal dependency and a build-dependency or proc-macro, the features for the normal dependency are kept independent of the build-dependency or proc-macro.
- **Target dependencies** — When a package appears multiple times in the build graph, and one of those instances is a target-specific dependency, then the features of the target-specific dependency are only enabled if the target is currently being built.

While this can lead to a compiling some crates more than once, this should provide a much more intuitive development experience when using features with cargo. If you'd like to know more, you can also read the ["Feature Resolver"][feature-resolver@2.0] section in the Cargo Book for more information. We'd like to thank the cargo team and everyone involved for all their hard work in designing and implementing this new feature (resolver)!

### Splitting Debug Information
While not often highlighted in the release, the Rust teams are constantly working on improving compile Rust's compile times, and this release marks one of the biggest improvements in a long time for Rust on macOS platforms. Debug information is code that maps the binary code back to your source code, so that the program can give you more information about what when wrong at run time. In macOS this is done with a tool called `dsymutil` which collects all the debug information into a single `.dSYM` file.

This tool provides a lot of benefits, however one of the drawbacks has been that `dsymutil` is not really compatible with incremental recompilation, so even when you make a small change such as a function name, `dsymutil` will need to run over the entire final binary to produce the final `.dSYM` folder. This can add a lot to the build time, especially for larger projects, however this has been a necessary step as without it Rust wouldn't be able to parse debug info on macOS.

However with the implementation of the Rust based `backtrace` crate backend, we're now able to parse debuginfo even without running `dsymutil`. This can significantly speed up builds that include debuginfo. We haven't ran extensive benchmarks but we've seen a lot of anecdata of people's builds building a lot faster on macOS with this behaviour.

You can enable this new behaviour by setting. the `-Csplit-debuginfo=unpacked` flag when running `rustc`, or by setting the [`split-debuginfo`] `[profile]` option to `unpacked` in Cargo.

```toml
[profile.dev]
split-debuginfo = "unpacked"
```

### Stabilized APIs

In total, this release saw the stabilisation of 18 new methods for various types like `slice` and `Peekable`. One notable addition is the stabilisation of `ptr::addr_of!` and `ptr::addr_of_mut!`, which allow you to create unaligned references to data	, previously this wasn't possible because Rust requires `&/&mut` to be aligned and point to initialized data, and `&addr as *const _` would cause undefined behaviour as `&addr` needs to be aligned. These two macros now let you safely create unaligned references.

```rust
use std::ptr;

#[repr(packed)]
struct Packed {
    f1: u8,
    f2: u16,
}

let packed = Packed { f1: 1, f2: 2 };
// `&packed.f2` would create an unaligned reference, and thus be Undefined Behavior!
let raw_f2 = ptr::addr_of!(packed.f2);
assert_eq!(unsafe { raw_f2.read_unaligned() }, 2);
```

The following methods were stabilised.

- [`Arc::decrement_strong_count`]
- [`Arc::increment_strong_count`]
- [`Once::call_once_force`]
- [`Peekable::next_if_eq`]
- [`Peekable::next_if`]
- [`Seek::stream_position`]
- [`array::IntoIter`]
- [`panic::panic_any`]
- [`ptr::addr_of!`]
- [`ptr::addr_of_mut!`]
- [`slice::fill_with`]
- [`slice::split_inclusive_mut`]
- [`slice::split_inclusive`]
- [`slice::strip_prefix`]
- [`slice::strip_suffix`]
- [`str::split_inclusive`]
- [`sync::OnceState`]
- [`task::Wake`]
